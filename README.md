Steps on how to create GitHub page: 
    1. Go to the repository that you want to be published.
    2. Under that repository, click 'Settings' (with a cog icon)
    3. On the left side of the page, under the contents of 'Code and Automation', click on "Pages"
    4. Under 'Build and deployment' (under the word 'Source'), kindly select "Deploy from a branch"
    5. Still under 'Build and deployment', on the 'Branch' part, select your publishing source. (i.e. main -> / (root))
    6. Click Save.
    7. Afterwards, go back to your repository, and click on the yellow circle that can be found in the same line as the number of commits that you have done.
    8. Wait for it to finish.
    9. After loading, go back to Settings > Pages
    10. Just refresh the page, and you should now be able to see the link of your respective webpage.

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
 -With this exercise, I was able to learn how to create an actual GitHub page. In addition, I was also able to learn deeper concepts regarding HTML and CSS. One of which is the use of flexbox. With the guidance of our instructor, we were able to implement the use of flexbox, and as well as other functions that we can use such as justify-content, align-items, etc.
