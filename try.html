                <span class="bold2">Good Leadership. </span> Over the years, I have seen myself initiate tasks, and try to lead people, most especially when
                there seems to be no one to move within our group. At first, it was something that I am just forced to do, but as I go through the years,
                people around me actually made me realize that I have to capacity to atleast take an initiative, to somehow guide my members
                to a fruitful result. Thankfully, all the efforts in leading have all been a success so far. <br> <br>

                <span class="bold">Effective Communication Skills. </span> I'm pretty much talkative, but not just talkative to the points that I would 
                just say whatever I'm thinking. I still see context of the situation, and act upon it.<br> <br>

                <span class="bold2">Ability to collaborate with others. </span> Other than being a leader, I am also a good listener. I am open to learning
                new things, as I believe that there are still a lot that I am yet to learn from other people. <br> <br>

                <span class="bold">Adapts easily to situations. </span> During pressured times, I often find myself not being swallowed by the situation.
                As much as possible, I try to remain calm and think rationally, and not let my emotions take over me. <br> <br>

                <span class="bold2">Reasonable Humor. </span> I believe working is not just pure working. I also have this sense of fun, but of course,
                it's not just a fun-fun thing and no work, but rather, it's a kind of work, while also having fun with other people.

                I am Nathaniel Cunanan, currently a 2nd-year student in University of the Philippines Los Baños. 
                Right now, I am trying to learn a lot of concepts with regards to Computer Science, 
                with guidance from our respective ICS instructors. For now, I would say that I am enjoying my stay here,
                most especially that I am finally learning about the insides of what I usually encounter on a day-to-day basis,
                as I play games, interact with other people through online means, and also study for my future.<br> <br>

                Ever since I was young, I was already exposed to computer. And such is most probably the reason 
                why I decided to pursue this degree program. In line with this, I am really excited to get to learn 
                more about the deeper concepts that I will need in order to further understand this digitalized world. 
                With the constant advancement in technology, it really is a must for people to get to learn about the basics, 
                and me, being able to really understand it at a deeper level, will surely help in the near future,  
                at least in one way or another. <br>

                Having been aware of how this journey is not so easy at all, I've come to realize a lot of things. One of which is 
                the essence of coding and programming. Features that we can see regularly are not done in just the blink of an eye.
                It takes a lot of time and effort from passionate people to actually get something to work, and truly, I am thankful for them.
                Sooner or later, I am hoping to also be the one to provide such services to people - being able to use what I learn as an undergraduate
                in BS Computer Science to make the lives of everyone a little bit better.
